# 2024-sba
School-Based Assessment for the 2024 HKDSE

## Build and deployment instructions
Practically the same as other svelte sites.

```bash
# Ensure Node.JS is installed and is at least v18.
$ node -v
# Ensure pnpm is installed
$ corepack enable pnpm
# Install project dependencies
$ pnpm install
# Run the development server
$ pnpm dev
```

This site is written to permit static rendering. That means the site can be
served with most, if not any, static web servers. To generate the site, run:

```bash
$ pnpm build
```

The resulting directory can be found in `$PWD/build`.
